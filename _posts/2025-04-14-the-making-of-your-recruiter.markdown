Today I removed Firecrawl in favor of OpenAI, and opened up signups for beta testing.

<h2>OpenAI</h2>

When I did my initial test on signups Firecrawl had a fews different rules for setup and required additional tooling in a production environment. I took another look at OpenAI documentation and found a decent extraction option within their O3-minis model. This is great for reducing overhead as all AI functions are now operating under one umbrella. I am conducting billing and useage test as OpenAI charges for extraction while Firecrawl did not. Should the operation costs prove to be too great I will reintroduce Firecrawl for the production environment.

<h2>Beta Testing</h2>

After conducting my own tests for signup, I had my friend <a href="https://github.com/Sam-sas" target="_blank">Sam</a> run through and provide feedback. After a few hiccups we were able to determine that the application was in a good spot to open it up to beta testing. I'm very excited to announce that the site has its Signup button available and you can explore all of the features of the recruiter with or without AI! I've included a link to issue reporting and feedback on the site in a notice with a link to the issues repo and invite you to provide feedback there or via <a href="mailto:thejenniferhaggerty@gmail.com">email</a>.
