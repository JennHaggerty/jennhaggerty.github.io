description: Jennifer's progress on the app.

Today I unleashed the Playground upon the world!

After much development and tweaking the app still was not ready for a formal production setting yet I wanted to get recruiters and hiring developers something to interact with so they could see the active progress I was making and where the app was heading.

I setup a playground database in my MongoDB Atlas instance and created a playground user with strict rules: the user could only read the playground database and they could only add, edit, and delete within the listings collection. There is a 5 document max, with the oldest document getting deleted with each new add. I announced the launch on LinkedIn and added a playground link to <a href="https://jenniferhaggerty.com">my website</a>.
