Now we're getting to the fun part, AI cover letter generation.

<h2>OpenAI</h2>

I'm using <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI's</a> o1-mini for the text generation. I did try using a higher price "smarter" tier and was really put off by the wording generation. With the higher tier it felt like I had given my own written cover letter to Shakespeare to jazz up and he sure did with a *lot* of fluff. The o1-mini writes cover letters oddly close to how I would normally write my own and I'm not sure how I feel about my writing skills learning that :D

Future Jennifer coming in to note: Initially I planned to leave the cover letter in the giant lump text it appears in the modal to force the user to review it line-by-line and check that the wording was accurate and the presentation presentable. Over time it made me enjoy the app less because I couldn't easily read what was generated without separating the paragraphs myself and re-reading it several times. I think it is more efficient to have the cover letter, and resume, written in a pretty format from the AI for easy scanning and corrections.
