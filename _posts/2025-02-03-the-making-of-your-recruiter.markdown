<h2>Legend</h2>

Today I added a site legend that details the color chart. I wanted a "style-guide" for the various actions available to the user to help them distinguish which actions were AI, which were manual, and which were destruction. 

<img src="/assets/your-recruiter-color-chart.png" alt="Your Recruiter Color Chart" />

The run down: 
<ul>
  <li>Blue is the action color. </li>
  <li>Purple is the color of AI.</li>
  <li>Gray is Neurtral.</li>
  <li>Green is success or cash money!</li>
  <li>Red is an Error.</li>
  <li>Yellow is a Warning Color.</li>
</ul>

Note from future Jennifer: Originally the Legend button was available in the Nav and would open a drawer. While this might be helpful for new users it clutters the Nav and saturates the dashboard with buttons as the user becomes familiar with the app. I've since moved the Legend button to the footer. 

I still find it extremely helpful when add new features and content to keep myself following its rule :D
