MyJobQuest.io, formerly Your Recruiter, has a new name and UI update.

<h2>What's Happening Now</h2>

I received user feedback that "feedback" would be much appreciated when the app is doing something in the background and the page is in loading state. Now the spinner 
will have text underneath the conveys a quick update about what's happpening behind the wizard's curtain.

This feedback is my new favorite thing! It relieves subtle stress caused by a lone spinneer; is it still working? Did it get stuck? What is it doing now?
Some of the text changes too quickly for me to fully read but I'd rather have this then allow time for the reader -- the point is to show that something *is* 
and it's going *so fast*!

<h2>The Name Change</h2>

"Your Recruiter" was the first name that popped into my head when I began building the app. 
This name doesn't really convey the many elements of this app and the single entity turned into a full campaign about a quest to find a career. 
MyJobQuest.io is a journal stuffed with career details, correspondances with party members, letters, documents, and datestamped logs. 

The new name is easy to type, rolls off the tongue, and was an available domain :D
